Putting Chinese Characters into Moving Bubbles: Is Hanzi Hunter an Accelerated Pathway to Memorizing 500 Characters in a Month?	

Achieving near-native proficiency in a second language usually takes years. After establishing a foundation in grammar, further progress is driven by expanding one's vocabulary to 15,000–20,000 words. For Chinese, this also means learning 3,000–5,000 characters. During this stage, the learning rate depends on two factors: (1) how much time is devoted to studying each day, and (2) the ability to maintain focus over time. Here, we introduce Hanzi Hunter, a Chinese character review app built to optimize both of these factors. Its core engine was originally a pure spaced repetition system. After each correct response, an item advances to a higher level. For example, it may be presented again in two, four, eight, 16, or 32 days. Errors reset the item to level 0 and trigger a day-1 review. Later, while addressing the increasing number of hard-to-remember characters, we rather serendipitously introduced an auxiliary "Hunt" session. In this session, a user-defined subset of characters floats by as gentle bubbles. Clicking on a bubble opens a card that displays the character, its pronunciation, its pinyin, an example sentence, text-to-speech functionality, and a link to an external dictionary. In a preliminary study, learners reported that they spent more time studying and retained more information after the introduction of the "Hunt" mode with moving bubbles. Extrapolation from session logs suggests that acquiring ~500 characters per month may be feasible. We attribute this impressive feat to the evolutionarily conserved reflex to scrutinize moving objects, which is common to all vision-guided animals, including humans. It has not escaped our notion that the Hanzi Hunter bubble interface could be adapted for vocabulary learning in all languages.
