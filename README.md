Putting Chinese Characters into Bubbles: Hanzi Hunter — A Novel Brain Gateway to Learn 500 Chinese Characters in 30 Days 

Achieving near-native proficiency in a second language usually takes years. After building a solid foundation in grammar, further progress depends on expanding one's vocabulary to more than 20,000 words. For Chinese, this also requires mastering 3,000–5,000 characters. At this stage, the learning rate depends on two factors: (1) how much time is devoted to studying each day, and (2) the ability to study with sustained, undivided attention. Here, we introduce Hanzi Hunter, a Chinese character review app designed to optimize both. Its core engine is a standard spaced repetition system. After each correct response, an item advances to a higher level. For example, it may be presented again in two, four, eight, 16, or 32 days. An incorrect response resets the item to level 0 and triggers a review the following day. During initial experimentation, we serendipitously hit upon the idea of an auxiliary "Hunt" session. In this session, a user-defined subset of characters floats by as gentle bubbles. Clicking a bubble opens a card displaying the character, its pronunciation, an example sentence that can be played aloud, and a link to the Pleco dictionary. In a preliminary study, learners reported studying longer and retaining more after the introduction of this moving-bubble mode. Session logs suggest that acquiring about 500 characters per month may be feasible. We attribute this unexpected finding to the evolutionarily conserved reflex to track moving objects, which is common to all vision-guided animals, including humans. It has not escaped our notice that the Hanzi Hunter bubble interface we have designed immediately suggests a promising avenue for vocabulary learning in all languages.
