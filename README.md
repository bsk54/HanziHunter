Putting Chinese Characters into Moving Bubbles: Is Hanzi Hunter a Brain Gateway to Memorizing 500 Characters in a Month?	

Achieving near-native proficiency in a second language usually takes years. After building a foundation in grammar, further progress depends on expanding vocabulary to 15,000–20,000 words. For Chinese, this entails mastering 3,000–5,000 characters. At this stage, the learning rate is shaped by two factors: (1) the time devoted to study each day and (2) the ability to sustain focus. Here, we introduce Hanzi Hunter, a Chinese character review app designed to optimize both. Its core engine is a standard spaced repetition system. After each correct response, an item advances to a higher level. For example, it may be presented again in two, four, eight, 16, or 32 days. Errors reset the item to level 0 and trigger a review the following day. During initial experimentation, we serendipitously hit upon the idea of an auxiliary ‘Hunt’ session. In this session, a user-defined subset of characters floats by as gentle bubbles. Clicking a bubble opens a card showing the character, pronunciation, pinyin, an example sentence (with click-to-audio), and a link to the Pleco dictionary. In a preliminary study, learners reported studying longer and retaining more after the introduction of this moving-bubble mode. Session logs suggest that acquiring about 500 characters per month may be feasible. We attribute this unanticipated finding to the evolutionarily conserved reflex to track moving objects, common to all vision-guided animals, including humans. It has not escaped our notice that the Hanzi Hunter bubble interface we have designed immediately suggests a promising avenue for vocabulary learning in all languages.
